WEEK 2 PROJECT

sorry for delay. was going to quit class,but found out i cant get a refund, so im back at it. :) -> work has manditory 10hr days right now. plus i have a parttime job too. last 2 weeks have been "HE-doubleHockySticks". im trying to find the time for this course. when i signed up it wasnt this crazy. plus fall college semester starts next week. I didnt realize we was working in the raw on this course. Ive been using tiva series controllers using CCS, and im self taught (using it at job two). wasnt this hard to figure out stuff using a IDE. ;-) lol  <Its not hard, its hard to remember>
I do want to add this certification. Ive been programming the C2000 series (F28377D Delfino) and Tiva-4 series for about a year now at my parttime company for variuos projects they do using the experiment-boards. {code, libraies, and proper linker file}, and the IDE does the rest.
